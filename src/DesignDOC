 Number Converter Project Design Document

 Overview

The Number Converter project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for converting numbers between different bases (binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal). The project is implemented in Java, utilizing object-oriented programming principles to organize the code.

 Components

 1. `NumberConverter` Class

 Responsibilities:
- Handle the conversion of numbers between different bases.
- Validate user input for the base and the entered number.
- Store the original number and its digits.

 Methods:
- `NumberConverter(int number, int base)`: Constructor for creating a NumberConverter object.
- `isValidNumber(String number, int base)`: Check if the entered number is valid for the specified base.
- `convertToBinary()`: Convert the original number to binary.
- `convertToOctal()`: Convert the original number to octal.
- `convertToHexadecimal()`: Convert the original number to hexadecimal.
- `convertToDecimal()`: Return the original number in decimal format.
- `displayOriginalNumber()`: Display the original number.

 2. `ConverterRunner` Class

 Responsibilities:
- Provide a user interface for interacting with the Number Converter.
- Get user input for the base and the number.
- Display the converted numbers based on user input.

 Methods:
- `main(String[] args)`: The entry point of the program; orchestrates user interactions and conversions.

 Design Considerations

 Input Validation

- Input for the base is validated to ensure it is one of the supported bases (2, 8, or 10).
- The entered number is validated to ensure it is a valid number for the specified base.

 Exception Handling

- IllegalArgumentExceptions are used to handle invalid user input gracefully.
- Errors are caught and displayed to the user for a better user experience.

 Separation of Concerns

- The `NumberConverter` class is responsible for handling conversions and maintaining the original number.
- The `ConverterRunner` class is responsible for user interactions and displaying results.

 Future Enhancements

1. Support for Additional Bases:
   - Extend the project to support additional bases, such as base-16 (hexadecimal).

2. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   - Implement a graphical user interface to enhance user experience.

3. Error Handling Improvements:
   - Enhance error handling to provide more descriptive messages for users.

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize the conversion algorithms for improved performance with large numbers.

 Conclusion

The Number Converter project is designed to be extensible, user-friendly, and maintainable. It adheres to best practices in object-oriented design and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
